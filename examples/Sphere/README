please have a look at the Xcompact3d readthedocs website for how to import an STL file and run the simulation for the flow around a sphere.

FIXME: This case will work when (https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/issues/63)[https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/issues/63] is fixed. To run the case, the current steps are :

1. Remove the lines `iforces = 1` and `nvol = 1` in the ibmstuff section of the input file
2. Remove the section ForceCVs of the input file
3. Run the python script `generate_initial_conditions.py`
4. Restore the input file (revert steps 1 and 2)
5. Run the case
